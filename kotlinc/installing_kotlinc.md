## installing kotlinc
The kotlin command line compiler is not included in ``kotlin2dart`` repository.

It must be downloaded from the kotlin github repository. For more details see [here](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html).
The content of the downloaded zip file must be put in this directory. 

The kotlin command line compiler is used for running some utility kotlin scripts that are used to 
automate some of the work for creating new k2dart code translation rules. 

If you already have the kotlin command line compiler installed in your system (and the ``bin`` directory in the
executable path) then you don't need to install it again here.
